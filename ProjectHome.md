Distributed Monitoring System (DMS) collects, stores, interprets and provides interface for querying data related to system resources of various nodes which are part of distributed system being monitored.  DMS is required for efficiently using distributed infrastructures.  Large scale distributed infrastructures are becoming common in various domains. High performance computing paradigm is changing from small number of high capability expensive hardware to a large number of commodity hardware. Similarly, nowadays enterprise data centers consist of large number of commodity hardware running thousands of different services. Using this type of infrastructure effectively requires constant monitoring of the entire infrastructure. Typically, administrator would like to have status information regarding the system resources being used and available at various nodes which are part of the distributed infrastructure.  There has been significant amount of work done in this regard [2, 3, 4]. However, they have some limitations. Massie et al. proposed Ganglia which has scaling issue because of its hierarchical design.  Zhu et al. design is customized for Grid architecture. The other motivation for this work was to come up with clean interfaces for data management, DHT routing interface and Remote Procedure Call library. The clean interfaces are required for easy portability of the application. Furthermore, clean interfaces facilitate reusability of various components.
